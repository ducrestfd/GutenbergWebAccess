    <!-- Example: Sharing files from external storage (scoped to your app's directory) -->
    <!-- For public directories like Downloads, you'd typically use external-files-path
    <external-files-path name="my_external_files" path="Download/Gutenbergaccess/" /> -->

    <!-- If you are trying to share from the public Downloads directory as you mentioned
         for "Downloads/Gutenbergaccess", this gets more complex with modern Android
         storage restrictions. Ideally, your app manages files in its own directories.
         If they are truly in the public Downloads, you might need to copy them to
         an app-specific cache dir first for sharing via FileProvider, or the receiving
         app needs appropriate permissions to access that public location (which your
         app cannot grant directly for ACTION_SEND).

         For files your app creates and stores in its own designated public directory like
         `Environment.getExternalStoragePublicDirectory(Environment.DIRECTORY_DOWNLOADS) + "/Gutenbergaccess"`,
         you might use: -->

        <external-path name="my_downloads" path="Download/Gutenberwebgaccess/" />
        <!-- Or more broadly if needed, but be specific for security -->
        <!-- <external-path name="external_files" path="." /> -->
